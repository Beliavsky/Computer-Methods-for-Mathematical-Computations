Code from the book by Forsythe, Malcolm, and Moler, translated to Fortran 90 by [Ralph Carmichael](https://www.pdas.com/fmm.html). Compile with `gfortran fmm.f90 testfunctions.f90 samples.f90`. Also compiles and runs with the ifx, ifort, and g95 compilers. The original routines in fixed format are in `original.f`.
